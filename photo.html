        One summer day my daughter brought home a lovely little kitten. I was trapped and tenderized. although aware of the mistake I was going to make I finally allowed her to adopt it. But here's the thing: the trouble with a kitten is that eventually it becomes a CAT.
        Fortunately, in summer a cat is bearable, he lives his life. But it’s not the same during the long icy rainy winterdays: It never goes outside anymore. And here begins the hell for the developper: naps on my laptop, hair, fleas and other dirt in my keyboard, my leg becomes a cat tree.
        and me trying to concentrate. IT'S A HELL. Cats are sneaky but maybe so do developers. Cats and developers are selfish, they don't recognize authority and they're mean for the fun of it. In fact, cats possess so many of the same qualities and flaws as some developers. People like pets that look like them.
        Cats are also intended to teach us that not everything in nature has a function. And that's what we can't accept.
        That’s why I wrote this useless article about a useless animal, to use its highest quality: attract attention and at the same time attract yours.
