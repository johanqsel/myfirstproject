                    <p class="question">Can you introduce yourself in a few words?? <br> </p>
                    No! In a few words I can't!
                    <br>
                    <p class="question">More seriously, what is your past as a developer? </p>
                    In high school, at the end of the 80s, I learned "turbo pascal", but then I dropped everything. I didn't have a personal computer which was very expensive and internet didn't exist yet.
                    I started to take an interest again in coding a year ago, after a long-term sick leave. But today I am much better and I have resumed my usual work. I'm just trying to put in
                    application what I learned.
                    <br>
                    <p class="question">You don't have a specific goal? </p>
                    Right now I'm just trying to see what I can do and what I could do. I am not yet a developer but
                    I hope I'm on the right path. I don't have the level of a professionnal. When I inspect the code of some websites, I am impressed
                    and I find it hard to understand everything although when I'm taking my time I often understand the process.
                    Maybe it's because I haven't learned yet a framework but it may come
                    <br>
                    <p class="question">And what are your weaknesses?</p> 
                    Undoubtedly, the design! To code something, I always manage to find a solution, even if it's not always a very "clean" code: I search, I think, I try, I look at what is being done
                     elsewhere ... But making it beautiful and original is what's most complicated for me ... I am someone who has a lot of logic but my artistic sense isn't sufficiently developed. 
                     I've to work on that, and maybe, open more my eyes when I'm surfing on the net but also in the real life. I can improve it.

                    If I have any suggestions, I will study the question of course, but I keep my feet on the ground. I am a self-taught person with no diploma. I learned everything on my own with the help of the internet. And, I think, my level is not yet sufficient.                    <br>
                    <p class="question">Talk us about your website</p>
                    This is my first real project. It isn't really a website. It's more a project made for myself to apply my knowledges and by introducing as much concepts as possible. But I must be able to show it and take some advice                   <br>
                    <p class="question">Are you satisfied?</p>
                    No, I'm not happy with the design. I wanted something original but I'm not satisfied.
                    And also I didn't have enough content. For example this interview is useless. Here I'm telling anything to have the material to be able to propose after a popup. I wanted a content that is something other than a "lorem"
                    Not sure that this interview is more interesting.
                    <br>
                    <p class="question">And why in English? You're settled in France, no?</p>
                    And why not? These days English is still the international language, especially in the IT environment, like it or not.
                    I have a medium level but sufficient, Although I'm doing better in French. And you can still make an automatic translation with your browser.

                        It's a "she". A real rascal. She does everything to attract attention. She loves my computer, especially the keys. A nightmare when you are focused and hard at work. But beside that, she's really cute.

                        <span class="question1">Does the photo of the eye have a special meaning? Is this yours?<br></span>
                        In fact I wanted to take a picture of my brain but my eye refused to leave room. If you look closely at the center you can see my brain in action.
                         Just kidding, don't try you won't see anything
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="question1">A few words about your game?<br></span>
                        I just follow a tutorial for the game "pong" and I adapted it to a solo-game. 
                        I wouldn't have been able to make it on my own. But I understood the process.
                        It was very educating
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="question1">What about your logo?<br></span>
                        It is 100% in css. I know this is not usually done. But it was a personal learning project following "css battle". I wanted to put it into practice.
                        I deliberately took simple colors: red, blue and green. The red represents the fire, the blue for the ocean and the green is the forest.
                        Now I know, it’s a bit megalomaniac to make his own logo!
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="question1">Other developers are doing it <br></span>
                        Yeah, but they don’t interview themselves.

            One summer day my daughter brought home a lovely little kitten. I was trapped and tenderized. although aware of the mistake I was going to make I finally allowed her to adopt it. But here's the thing: the trouble with a kitten is that eventually it becomes a CAT.
            Fortunately, in summer a cat is bearable, he lives his life. But it’s not the same during the long icy rainy winterdays: It never goes outside anymore. And here begins the hell for the developper: naps on my laptop, hair, fleas and other dirt in my keyboard, my leg becomes a cat tree.
            and me trying to concentrate. IT'S A HELL. Cats are sneaky but maybe so do developers. Cats and developers are selfish, they don't recognize authority and they're mean for the fun of it. In fact, cats possess so many of the same qualities and flaws as some developers. People like pets that look like them.
            Cats are also intended to teach us that not everything in nature has a function. And that's what we can't accept.
            That’s why I wrote this useless article about a useless animal, to use its highest quality: attract attention and at the same time attract yours.

                    JQ wants to become a developer and for it he put in place a flexible learning plan. 
                    However the situation is not simple and requires a lot of organisation.
                    Indeed, unfortunaly JQ is obliged at the same time to continue a professional activity to feed his family.
                    The main risks are overworking and discouragement. But he found his rhythme after some trial and error.
                    So let's discover his planning: <br>
                    -JQ works professionaly 35 hours a week. <br>
                    -He learns 4 hours/day, 6days/week. <br>
                    -2 hours of lessons before going to work.
